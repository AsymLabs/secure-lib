<a name="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Bash library <code>secure-lib</code> can be used to help harden Bash scripts against
malicious use.  For most purposes this would not be needed but in the case a 
script is used on a public network or as a cgi file then it may be justified.
Of course if one is also truly paranoid it may be of interest too.  </p>

<p>Generally it is considered good security practice when using binary tools to
provide the full path to the binary when invoked.  To facilitate this action,
<code>secure-lib</code> provides the association <code>safe[]</code>.  For example grep may be
called with a full path by invoking <code>${safe[grep]}</code>.  This association can be
extended depending upon specific needs.  </p>

<p><code>secure-lib</code> was inspired in part by the excellent <em>Bash Cookbook, Albing,
Vossen and Newham, O'reilly, 2007</em>.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="motivation" class="anchor" href="#motivation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Motivation</h3>

<p>Bash can introduce security risks within public system.   Often breaches
are specific to the PATH variable and alias. Malicious software is easily 
accessed within a user area by modification of the PATH variable.  This library
attempts to isolate some of those risks - and provide additional safeguards.  </p>

<h3>
<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h3>

<p>Bash 4+ and nothing else.  For earlier versions, there are workarounds for 
associations (key value maps) but we leave this as an exercise for others.   </p>

<h1>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h1>

<p>Features include basic security for most scripts that can be tightened
significantly, where required, and a safe association that can be used to
facilitate tighter security.  </p>

<h1>
<a name="usage" class="anchor" href="#usage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Usage</h1>

<p>This is not a Bash executable.  Source it at the beginning of your executable
script with:  </p>

<div class="highlight highlight-bash"><pre><span class="nb">source</span> <span class="s1">'/your/path/to/secure-lib'</span>  
</pre></div>

<p>That's it.  </p>

<h1>
<a name="examples" class="anchor" href="#examples"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Examples</h1>

<p>You can invoke the safe association as follows:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>[user@a52j lib]$ source secure-lib<br>
[user@a52j lib]$  </p>

<p>[user@a52j lib]$ ${safe[grep]} 'secure' secure-lib.md<br>
